    <p class="w "> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur">Dinosaurs</a>  are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 245 and   233.23 million years ago <br> (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs  is a subject of active research.  They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after  the <br> Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued  throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that birds are <br> feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the  Cretaceous <br>–Paleogene  extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs,  which are <br> all  dinosaurs other than birds.

<h3>Distinguishing anatomical features</h3>
<div>
    <p class="qqq">While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of their distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs  discovered so far <br> share  certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton, or are clearly descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later <br> groups  of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to <br>their descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the synapomorphies of such a group.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>In the skull, a supratemporal fossa (excavation) is present in front of the supratemporal fenestra, the main opening in the rear skull roof</li>
    <li>Epipophyses, obliquely backward-pointing processes on the rear top corners of the anterior (front) neck vertebrae behind the atlas and axis, the first two neck <br> vertebrae</li>
    <li>Apex of a deltopectoral crest (a projection on which the deltopectoral muscles attach) located at or more than 30% down the length of the humerus  <br>(upper arm bone)</li>
    <li>Radius, a lower arm bone, shorter than 80% of humerus length</li>
    <li>Fourth trochanter (projection where the caudofemoralis muscle attaches on the inner rear shaft) on the femur (thigh bone) is a sharp flange</li>
    <li>Fourth trochanter asymmetrical, with distal, lower, margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft
    <li>On the astragalus and calcaneum, upper ankle bones, the proximal articular facet, the top connecting surface, for the fibula occupies less than 30% of the <br> transverse  width of the element</li>

<p class="aaa">Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in England. Part of a bone,  now known to have been the femur of a Megalosaurus,[43] was recovered from  a limestone quarry at  Cornwell near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, in 1676. The fragment was sent to Robert Plot, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum, who published a description in his The Natural History of Oxford-shire (1677).[44] He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He, therefore, concluded it to be the femur of a huge human, perhaps a Titan or another type of giant featured in legends.[45][46] Edward Lhuyd, a friend of Sir Isaac Newton, published Lithophylacii Britannici ichnographia (1699), the first scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a sauropod tooth, "Rutellum impicatum",[47][48] that had been found in Caswell, near Witney, Oxfordshire.[</p>
